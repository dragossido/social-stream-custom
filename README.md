### Overview
Your Bot is a conversational chatbot developed using JavaScript. It runs on the social stream project that can be found here: https://github.com/steveseguin/social_stream
It's designed to respond to common emoticons and questions in a personalized way, incorporating user names and offering silly/funny answers to questions with
special keywords.

### Goals and Features
* Respond to common emoticons. streaming emoticons owned by Kick, Twitch, D-live and questions.
* Incorporate user names into responses for a more personalized touch.
* Offer silly/funny answers to questions with special keywords (e.g. "streaming", "lottery", "boss", "game", or
"food").
* Developed entirely with JavaScript, no AI required!

### Technical Details
Your Bot uses social stream project that can be found here: https://github.com/steveseguin/social_stream

### How it Works
1. Start your question with a "!" to trigger the bot's response.
2. Use keywords like "streaming", "lottery", "boss", "game", or "food" to get humorous and personalized answers.

### Examples
* "! Do you have suggestions for streaming?"
* "! Can I win the lottery?"
* "! Can I defeat the boss?"
* "! Do I win the game?"
* "! Which food can I prepare for dinner?"

* In this case in the chat "GPB_222" typed an emoticon and the bot replied as was me but becoming "GPB_222Bot"

### Future Plans
* Add support for more emoticons and keywords
* Ask users which keywords they would like
* May be a Discord version

Your Bot is designed specifically for use during live-streaming sessions. It's not intended for general chat or
messaging outside of these sessions. Your Bot will only respond to user input when you're actively
streaming and engaging with your audience.

### Detailed description
This is a custom JS for the social stream Project.

This Project aims to create a bot in JavaScript that interacts with people and runs on the social stream project that can be found here: https://github.com/steveseguin/social_stream

I have called this project "Your Bot" 
A normal bot replies to users when the user types "!" followed by a command.
Initially, I thought the same approach but decided to go a little forward.
"Your Bot" replies to emoticons and some of the questions that have specific words in it.

example: 
a normal bot with the command "!Weather" tells you how the weather is. 
"Your bot" you can type "!How is the weather today?" and not only reply but use as reply your user name followed by "YourBot".
So for example if your username is "carlins" and you ask "!How is the weather today?" 
You will have that reply "carlinsYourBot: the weather is pretty good today."

I have developed this project with my personal preferences and with silly, fun and joke answers.
I hope to have enough time to develop more

All files that have "custom.back" in the name are backups and notes.
